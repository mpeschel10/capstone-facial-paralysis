To run upload.py, you will need the following ssh config:

Host fa-test
    HostName test.fa.mpeschel10.com
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/root@test.fa.mpeschel10.com
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPersist 600
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/control:%h:%p:%r

Paste it in your ~/.ssh/config file on Linux.
To get an IdentityFile, please contact msp5393@psu.edu



I use nginx to handle the tls stuff. You need to run
    nginx -t && nginx -s reload
in order for changes to any of the *.conf files in deployment to take effect.
When nginx gets a request, it does the tls, then proxy_passes to localhost:3000.
I have a "service" set up for doing npm run dev to start the next.js server;
start it by running
    systemctl start fa-test-server
Stop it by running
    systemctl stop fa-test-server
To make it run when the system reboots, do
    systemctl enable fa-test-server
and to prevent it from running automatically on reboot, do
    systemctl disable fa-test-server



next.js needs more recent node than the node 18 that comes with Debian 12. I installed node 20 with the following instructions:
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions
Reproduced here as deployment/nodesource-install.md
